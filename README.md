# fiche with hastebin support

Simple fork of [fiche](https://github.com/solusipse/fiche), modified for uploading to [hastebin](https://github.com/toptal/haste-server) data directories.

Essentially hastebin uses md5 on the filenames, so that's what we do here.

Configuration should be pretty straight forward if you've worked with fiche before, just make sure your data dir points to hastebin's datadir.
